Design notes on sensory prose — what the game world produces in each sensory channel, and how state shapes what surfaces to attention.

This feeds the prose compositor system (see docs/research/prose-construction.md) and the trigger model (see docs/design/triggers.md).

## Core principle

**Noticeability, not intensity.** The threshold for prose mentioning a sensory fact is not that it's strong — it's that it's *noticeable*. Salience, not magnitude. Petrichor isn't intense but it surfaces to attention. The smell of your own apartment after days away is subtle but tells you something.

**Noticeability is relational.** The same sensory fact is more or less noticeable depending on the character's current state. This is not a fixed property of the stimulus — it's a relationship between stimulus and state.

NT modulation of noticeability:
- Hunger → food smells and sights surface that would otherwise be ignored
- NE high → everything more present; sensory input harder to screen out
- Adenosine high → sensory input flattens; things recede
- GABA low → can't filter; minor sensory facts intrude
- Dopamine low → things that would normally register (the coffee brewing) may not

## Smell

### What the game world produces

**Social signals** — carry information about another person, not just atmosphere:
- Cologne or perfume (noticeable amount)
- Tobacco smoke on someone's clothes or breath
- Alcohol breath (theirs or your own, morning after)
- Other breath (general proximity)
- Sweat (crowded transit in summer, after exertion)

**Interaction-tied** — inseparable from a specific action or state:
- Vomit (after being sick)
- Coffee brewing
- Old food or trash in the apartment (when it's crossed a threshold)
- The smell of your own bed after sleeping too long in it
- Cleaning products — bleach, disinfectant; clinical, effortful

**Locational/ambient** — ambient to being somewhere:
- Freshly baked bread or fresh fruit (market, supermarket)
- Dumpsters / refuse (alley, back of building)
- Rain / petrichor (outside, just after rain starts or stops)
- Exhaust / bus fumes (transit, busy road)
- Mildew (bathroom, old building)
- Fresh air contrast when stepping outside from a stuffy interior

### Still to think about
- How smell interacts with memory (Proustian — certain smells are character-specific loaded)
- Character sentiments toward specific smells (someone who loves petrichor vs. finds it oppressive)
- Smell as absence (the apartment smells wrong — something missing, or something added)

## Sound

### What the game world produces

**Ambient indoor — present but filtered:**
- Appliances: fridge hum, coil whine from electronics, heating/AC
- Building: pipes, elevator, neighbors (footsteps, music, voices through walls)
- Own space: TV on in another room, radio, the specific quality of silence in a familiar room

**Ambient outdoor:**
- Traffic: general road noise, passing trucks (felt as much as heard — physical pressure, brief vibration)
- Weather: rain on windows, wind
- Nature: birds (time of day, season)
- People: street conversations, music from a passing car

**Overwhelming environments** — where sound is the dominant physical fact, changes behavior:
- Busy road: a passing truck makes conversation impossible for three seconds; you lean in to talk
- Concert: bass felt in the sternum, crowd heat and press, sound as a physical environment not just a perception

**Latent-until-noticed** — always present, surfaces when state crosses a threshold:
- Coil whine (electronics)
- Fridge hum
- HVAC / building ventilation
- Tinnitus (for characters who have it — always there, louder in quiet)

**Social/communicative:**
- Phone notifications
- Alarm
- Someone's phone on speaker nearby (public)
- Overheard conversation (transit, café)

**Silence** — the absence of expected sound is itself a sensory fact:
- 3am quiet
- Coming home to an empty apartment
- The moment after a loud environment

### NT modulation
- NE high → sounds intrude; edges sharpen; small sounds too present; harder to screen out
- GABA low → can't filter; the fridge hum, the coil whine, all of it competing
- Adenosine high → sounds recede; things that would normally register don't
- Dissociation → sounds present but not landing, arriving from a distance

### Still to think about
- Sound as physical sensation (bass, passing trucks) — overlaps with touch/proprioception
- Character sentiments toward specific sounds (someone who finds rain calming vs. oppressive)
- The specific texture of silence for a character who lives alone vs. one used to noise
