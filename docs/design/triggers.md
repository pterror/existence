How events, prose fragments, and sensory moments get surfaced in the game.

## Core principle

Triggers are just conditions. A sensory fragment, an ambient event, an idle thought — anything that fires without direct player action — fires because some set of conditions became true. The conditions can be anything: state thresholds, location, time of day, transitions between locations, co-occurrence with another action, combinations of the above.

There is no fixed taxonomy of trigger types. The number and kinds of conditions is open-ended. Don't enumerate categories and then ask which one something belongs to — just ask: what conditions make this true?

## What conditions can look like

- State threshold: hunger > X, adenosine > Y, NE crosses a level
- Location: character is at home, at work, outside
- Transition: character just arrived somewhere, just left somewhere
- Time: time of day, time since last sleep, time since last ate
- Co-occurrence: firing alongside or immediately after another action
- Object state: phone has unread messages, TV is on
- Combination: any of the above together

## What this applies to

Everything that fires without a player action:
- Ambient sensory fragments (coil whine, stomach gurgling, cold air, a passing truck)
- Idle thoughts
- Ambient events (sounds from the street, weather changes)
- NT-driven prose modulation

The same trigger machinery applies to all of them. Sensory fragments are not a special case.

## Previous wrong framing

An earlier attempt to categorize sensory events produced three buckets: "truly independent," "situation-ambient," and "latent-until-noticed." This was wrong — it was categorizing content by its typical trigger pattern and treating that pattern as a property of the content. A stomach gurgle isn't a different *kind* of thing from coil whine; it just has different trigger conditions. The content is the same kind of thing. The trigger conditions vary.
