Wake up at seven o'clock
this is how it's supposed to be
and keep a radiant smile
so the others see

Work on a regular pace
when someone tells you to
can't you obey?
What is so wrong with you?

Why can't I be like them
I have tried to befriend them
I feel like it's nature
that drives me away
from your designs

What you like, what you talk, what you strive
I can't imagine being like you
I don't believe in your bible
repeat all your cycles, yeah
the way you live is only causing me pain
your life's so dull
I could never
but you claim you know better
why am I the one that's getting punished for it

I am divergent, creative
come give it a try
if I told you how to behave
you'd know the suffering of mine
I don't believe you are better
no spirit, no ember
but you surely know
making my life into hell

---

Why can't I live in peace
you just dig underneath
I can't go on my life without hearing my fault
in my designs
what I like, what I talk, what I strive
I can't be a little different from you
I don't believe in your bible
repeat all your cycles, yeah
the way you live is only causing me pain
your life's so dull
I could never
but you claim you know better
why am I the one that's getting punished for it

I am divergent, creative
come give it a try
if I told you how to behave
you'd know the suffering of mine
I don't believe you are better
no spirit, no ember
but you surely know
making my life into hell

Oh, I am so different (x4)

[Bridge — from Portuguese, not clear in phonetic transcription:]
I stop for a moment to see
what you all talk about
but every time a smile appears
it only gives me chills
I don't agree with these styles
but I keep it to myself
and now I don't need
your help

[Chorus x2]
I don't believe in your bible
repeat all your cycles, yeah
the way you live is only causing me pain
your life's so dull
I could never
but you claim you know better
why am I the one that's getting punished for it

I am divergent, creative
come give it a try
if I told you how to behave
you'd know the suffering of mine
I don't believe you are better
no spirit, no ember
but you surely know
making my life into hell
