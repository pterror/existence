a place for the tainted
nothing but a sound/
I try to be frank with you but words won't leave my mouth/

I'd lie if I
could take little more
what was I resting for/

some day
there's a point of break where I will beg me to stay/
where I was before my hand kept missing the brakes/

1000 miles an hour I come back home and I
fade, fade/

I have a stone that's crushing me on top of my chest
I pray for peace e- everytime I walk to my bed
oh how i wish to tell you something worth your time here with me
already breaking as the person that I'm trying to be

for everytime i forced myself to push through my bounds
I hear a cry a child in me that wants to be proud
I said it's love until I realised it's hate in disguise
I hate myself for times I wasn't able making it right oh

I take the pain and lock it deeply
cause I deserve it
I take the shame and lock it deeply
cause I deserve it
I take the stress and lock it deeply
cause I deserve it
I took my state and kept it in me
cause I'm „so perfect"  (2x)

interlude:

when I close my eyes
when I close my eyes
when I close my eyes
I can feel my heart it's pushing now/

pressure me all night/
pressure me all night/
pressure me all night/
wonder what the fuck I'm doing now/

I don't wanna try (12x)
to push myself for now/

I just want the fight/
I just want the fight/
I just want the fight/
I just want the fight to settle down/

I just want a night (5x)
to let it out/

I just wanna cry (12x)
it out in pain aloud/
(2x)

I have a stone that's crushing me on top of my chest
I pray for peace e- everytime I walk to my bed
oh how i wish to tell you something worth your time here with me
already breaking as the person that i'm trying to be

for everytime i forced myself to push through my bounds
I hear a cry a child in me that wants to be proud
I said it's love until I realised it's hate in disguise
I hate myself for times I wasn't able making it right oh (2x)

I take the pain and lock it deeply
cause I deserve it
I take the shame and lock it deeply
cause I deserve it
I take the stress and lock it deeply
cause I deserve it
I took my state and kept it in me
cause I'm „so perfect"  (2x)
